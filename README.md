# PyTorch-3D-IBN-Net

PyTorch-3D-IBN-Net is a powerful deep learning architecture that combines the strengths of 3D ResNets and Instance-Batch Normalization networks (IBN-Net) for processing three-dimensional data. This repository is an integration of two existing repositories: [3D-ResNets-PyTorch](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch) and [IBN-Net](https://github.com/XingangPan/IBN-Net).

## Introduction

**3D-ResNets-PyTorch Repository:**
This repository provides implementations of 3D convolutional neural networks based on the ResNet architecture. ResNet is known for its ability to handle deep networks effectively using residual blocks.

**IBN-Net Repository:**
The IBN-Net is a normalization technique that combines instance normalization and batch normalization, offering improved feature learning capabilities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to create an integrated architecture that leverages both 3D ResNet and IBN-Net techniques. By doing so, we aim to achieve superior feature extraction and representation learning from 3D data, making the architecture suitable for tasks like action recognition in videos, medical image analysis, and more.

## Key Features

- Integration of 3D ResNet architecture with IBN-Net techniques.
- Improved feature learning by adapting to both instance-level and batch-level statistics.
- Potential for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various 3D vision tasks.
- A general framework for building custom 3D deep learning architectures.
